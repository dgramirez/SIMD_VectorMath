SIMD_VectorMath

This small project was to create a Math Library using SIMD. This is here mainly for portfolio purposes (Educational too, although the code is a bit messy.)

I used another blank Math Engine as a template. (EngineMath.h and EngineMath.cpp from FullSail University). Of course, i modified some of the templated aspects (vec4 is just a typedef of __m128, not a union as one example).

Ultimately, This whole project was created with an interest in learning SIMD Intrinsics. There was a lot of interesting things going through this process. If interested, look at the code and here is two references that i used to get me going:
